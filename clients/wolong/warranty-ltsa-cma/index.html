<p>9.5 <strong>Liquidated Damages (LDs)</strong> for Availability shortfall (monthly):</p>
<p>LD = <strong>[$/point/% shortfall]</strong> × (Target% − Achieved%) × <strong>[Contracted Power or Fee Base]</strong>; cap per month = <strong>[●]%</strong> of Monthly Service Fee; annual LD cap = <strong>[●]%</strong> of Annual Fee. LDs are <strong>sole remedy</strong> for SLA shortfall (excluding willful misconduct/gross negligence).</p>
